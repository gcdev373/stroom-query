/**
 * If a model is part of an API it should often not be changed without re-versioning, - otherwise anything that depends
 * on it could fail. But it is easy, in the heat of a big change, to forget one has changed a model. This test is meant
 * to catch these cases and alert the developer.
 *
 * After being alerted of the model change a developer will probably want to follow some model-change process. After doing
 * that the test that fails here could be resolved by temporarily uncommenting the line in the test that writes out the
 * model's portrait. Don't commit this test with the line uncommented! If you do the test will always pass.
